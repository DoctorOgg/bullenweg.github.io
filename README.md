#### Announces Advanced Custom Fields security vulnerability

In a [since deleted tweet](https://x.com/automattic/status/1842612123488473341) Automattic (Matt) violated responsible disclosure by announcing a vulnerability in WPEngine's ACF plugin.

> Automattic's security team has responsibly disclosed a vulnerability in @wp_acf to @wpengine. As is standard, they have 30 days to issue a fix before public disclosure. We have reserved this CVE for the issue: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9529

#### Refuses to leave former Automattic employee Slack channel

> @photomatt joins the chat and refuses to leave after being asked politely. A safe space for former automatticians.

Per [Mike Julian on Twitter](https://x.com/mike_julian/status/1842760610393825723):

### 2024-09-24

#### Modifies WordPress Trademark Policy

Matt modifies the [WordPress trademark policy](https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/) to add:

> The abbreviation “WP” is not covered by the WordPress trademarks, but please don’t use it in a way that confuses people. For example, many people think WP Engine is “WordPress Engine” and officially associated with WordPress, which it’s not. They have never once even donated to the WordPress Foundation, despite making billions of revenue on top of WordPress.
> 
> If you would like to use the WordPress trademark commercially, please contact Automattic, they have the exclusive license. Their only sub-licensee is Newfold.
